When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever the file is important, so if my computer break i can acess the files on cloud.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it is possible that i dont want to send some change to the cloud (gitHub)


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clone is like a copy from the web to your computer our from a folder in your computer to another. Fork is like a clone for the directory, but only in GitHub. Branches are like a copy of a file, and the reason you do this is for making changes at your file without changing the original.
