When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever the file is important, so if my computer break i can acess the files on cloud.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it is possible that i dont want to send some change to the cloud (gitHub)


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clone is like a copy from the web to your computer our from a folder in your computer to another. Fork is like a clone for the directory, but only in GitHub. Branches are like a copy of a file, and the reason you do this is for making changes at your file without changing the original.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If you have this copy, you can then compare it with your local master to possibly merge both.



When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

If you are working with someone else, you might want first create a new branch to add the modification and pull a request so your colaborator can check if he agrees with the changes before you merge the commit which contains the change with the master.
